Open a terminal, then run the following command:\n\n$ mamba create -n scahpy_env scahpy xarray wrf-python metpy\nThe commands above install the latest stable release of SCAHpy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor experts: Use the following command to Create an environment identical to the IGP environment used to test the package:\n\n\n$ conda env create -f LINK_TO_YAML_FILE\nThen, activate the SCAHpy IGP environment:\n$ mamba activate scahpy_igp"
