## **What is SCAHpy?**

**SCAHpy** (System for Coupled Atmosphere–Hydrosphere Analysis in Python) is an open-source Python package designed to facilitate the analysis, diagnostics, and visualization of the Regional Earth System Model implemented by the *Instituto Geofísico del Perú* (**IGP RESM-COW**), a coupled ocean atmosphere system over the Peruvian territory and the eastern Pacific.

The **IGP RESM-COW** system integrates: the atmospheric model **WRF**, the ocean model **CROCO** and, the coupler **OASIS**,

This modeling system supports scientific research at the IGP by providing high-resolution simulations for studies of oceanic dynamics, atmospheric processes, and climate variability along the Peruvian region.

## **Why SCAHpy?**

The atmospheric and oceanic components of the IGP RESM-COW produce massive amounts of NetCDF data, often distributed across daily, monthly, or multi-year simulation files.  
Processing these outputs can be challenging due to:

- heterogeneous dimensions and coordinate conventions,  
- different vertical representations (sigma, pressure levels),  
- calendar and timezone handling (UTC/local time),  
- temporal concatenation of multiple files,  
- extraction of vertical and horizontal sections,  
- the need for reproducible scientific workflows.

**SCAHpy** addresses these challenges by providing:

- standardized functions to read WRF and CROCO outputs,  
- robust handling of coordinates and dimensions,  
- vertical transformations (sigma → pressure levels),  
- atmospheric and oceanic diagnostics,  
- high-level visualization tools (maps, vertical sections, time series),  
- reproducible workflows both locally and in HPC environments.

SCAHpy significantly reduces the time required for scientific post-processing, allowing researchers to focus on physical interpretation rather than data handling.

## **How to use SCAHpy?**

To begin, visit the **[Usage](02_use_en.qmd)** page and the tutorials listed below.

::: callout-note
SCAHpy has been developed and validated primarily with outputs from the **IGP RESM-COW** system; however, it is compatible with any *WRF*, *CROCO*, or NetCDF dataset following CF-Conventions.
