## **What is SCAHpy?**

***SCAHpy*** is an open-source Python package developed as a post-processing tool for the atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrological components of the regional Earth System Model covering the Peruvian territory and the Pacific Ocean. This model, named *IGP-RESM-COW v1*, was implemented by the *Geophysical Institute of Peru* (IGP) under the basis of the atmospheric *WRF* model, the oceanic *CROCO* model and the coupler *OASIS*.

## **Why is SCAHpy?**

The Python package SCAHpy was created to address the significant challenge posed by the processing of data generated by the IGP-RESM-COW model. This model, with its atmospheric component based on the WRF model, produces massive amounts of data during simulations, which require considerable time for post-processing. SCAHpy streamlines this process by homogenizing coordinates and dimensions, ensuring compatibility and facilitating data analysis. By simplifying data handling and preparation.

## **How to use SCAHpy?**

SCAHpy can be used as a standalone package, to get more details go to [Usage](02_use.qmd) and tutorials.

::: callout-note
SCAHpy has been developed and tested using IGP-RESM-COWv1 model outputs. However, it is designed to work with any WRF outputs. We are open to contributions from users!
