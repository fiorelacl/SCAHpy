## **What is SCAHpy?**

***SCAHpy*** is an open-source Python package that facilitate the analysis and visualization of the ouputs from atmospheric, oceaninc and hydrological component from the Geophysical Institute of Peru Regional Earth System Model Croco-Oasis-WRF (IGP-RESM-COW)

![COW Model - Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Model](cow_model.jpg){width="274"}

## **Why is SCAHpy?**

Atmospheric component of the coupled model generate a large volumes of output data, making the analysis of model data harder. SCAHpy facilitates the manage of this volumes of data, also enables a manage of coordinates and times to local times. 

## **How to use SCAHpy?**

SCAHpy can be used as a standalone package or it can also be run on the HPC-IGP-Cluster, which has the diagnostic simulations of 22 years of runnings centered on Peru Region. 

::: {.callout-note}
SCAHpy has been developed and tested using IGP-RESM-COW model outputs. However, it is designed to work with any WRF outputs. We are open to contributions from users!
